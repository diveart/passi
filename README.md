NAME
    passi is a simple yet powerful and convenient password manager.

COMPLETE MODERN PASSWORD MANAGEMENT LIFECYCLE
Passi provides a full-featured password management workflow covering every aspect of modern credential handling. Generate secure passwords with passi genp, store them with structured metadata using passi add, and retrieve credentials instantly via passi show or passi clip, or browse interactively with passi i. For two-factor authentication, scan QR codes from authenticator setup screens with passi qr screenshot.png to extract TOTP secrets, then generate time-based one-time passwords on demand with passi totp. From initial password creation to daily authentication workflows, passi handles the complete security lifecycle without requiring multiple tools or complex integrations.

üéØ DESIGN TRADE-OFFS
Passi prioritizes:
- Simple code over extensive functionality
- But simple data format over simple code
- Human-readable data over format performance optimization
- Single file over complex directory structure
- Metadata privacy over filesystem convenience
- Symmetric encryption over asymmetric key sharing
- Master password in your head over managing keys and certificates   

NOTABLE ADVANTAGES

1. TYPO-PROOF SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION
Passi prevents accidental password changes by validating your master password against the existing password storage file before allowing any modifications. When you enter the password for encryption, passi first tests that this same password can successfully decrypt your existing data - eliminating the risk of typos creating an inaccessible password storage file.
So this is impossible with passi even though you use symmetric encryption:
"I was editing my password database at 2 AM, made a typo during the re-encryption, and now my 10 years of passwords are locked away forever because I can't figure out what I mistyped."

2. ULTIMATE BACKUP FLEXIBILITY
Passi's single-ASCII-file design means you can backup your entire password storage file using any method imaginable. Print the encrypted file directly (cat vault.asc | lpr) for fireproof storage in a safe, or print the decrypted contents (gpg -d vault.asc | lpr) for emergency access without computers. Email the encrypted file to yourself, paste it into secure notes in your favorite messenger, or simply copy-paste the text content anywhere you trust. Unlike directory-based password managers that require special backup procedures, passi works with every communication method humans have invented.

3. MULTIPLE PASSWORD STORAGE FILES
Passi makes it trivial to maintain separate encrypted password storage files for different contexts using the `file` command. Keep personal passwords in `personal.asc`, work credentials in `work.asc`, and client access in `clients.asc` - each with their own master password, switched instantly with `passi file work.asc show`.

4. SIMPLE YET POWERFUL SECURITY MODEL
Passi uses straightforward "one master password" symmetric AES encryption, avoiding complex key management while being more quantum-resistant than RSA/ECC systems. At ~800 lines of readable bash code, it's simple enough to audit yet strong enough to hide everything in a single encrypted blob without revealing any metadata.

5. MODERN INTERFACE
Passi provides a sleek interactive experience with fzf-powered selection menus instead of clunky tab completion, letting you visually browse and search your passwords. Smart field extraction means you can copy passwords, usernames, or 2FA codes to clipboard with simple commands like passi clip, passi clipu, or passi clipt. The flexible data structure lets you introduce any fields you need - from recovery emails to security questions - structuring your private data exactly how you want it.
